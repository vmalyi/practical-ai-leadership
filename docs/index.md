> **I help companies build, scale, and reliably ship their AI initiatives.** I bridge the gap from R&D to production by diagnosing their landscape to create a strategic path. I then provide the hands-on engineering leadership to build the system, assemble and mentor the team, and ensure a full handoff.

## What I Take Off Your Plate

1. **The Strategy-to-Code Gap**: I'm the person who both designs the plan and supports with your engineers to build it. Nothing gets lost in translation.

2. **Wasted Time on "What If" Projects**: I stop the endless meetings and instead build 2-3 day prototypes. We only spend time scaling what actually works.

3. **Team Bottlenecks and Inefficiency**: I embed with your team to introduce modern, AI-assisted coding practices and build better engineering workflows.

4. **The Guesswork of Building a Team**: I define the exact roles you need for the long term and mentor your engineers as we build, so they are ready to succeed on their own.

5. **Uncertainty in Hiring AI Leaders**: If you need to fill a key leadership role, I can step in to define the position, help vet candidates, and refine your hiring process.

## The Pragmatic AI Loop

**My Framework: AI Strategy by Building**

My approach is simple: **"AI Strategy by Building."** I avoid endless theoretical meetings and instead build things quickly with your team to learn what works. Then, we scale the parts that deliver real value.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-flask-outline: **I Test Ideas with Prototypes**

    Instead of debating an idea for weeks, I build a working prototype with your team in 2-3 days. This provides real-world feedback, so we make decisions based on what *actually* works.

- :material-target: **I Focus on What's Real**

    I start with two essential questions. First: is your data ready? This is the most common blocker. Second: how will we measure success from day one? If a project doesn't show real value, we don't waste time on it and pivot instead.

- :material-account-group: **I Build It With Your Team**

    AI is a team sport, not just an IT project. I embed directly with your team, making sure people own their work and that key partners are on board from the start.

- :material-shield-check: **I Build for People & Compliance**

    I design compliance, like the EU AI Act, in from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

- :material-school: **I Focus on Empowering Your Team**

    My goal is to build your team's long-term capability, not create a dependency. As I build, I actively mentor your engineers and document our process. This is a complete knowledge transfer, ensuring your team has the autonomy to confidently own, operate, and evolve the system independently.

## Client "After" State

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-rocket-launch: **System & Capability**

    **You are reliably shipping AI initiatives.** You have moved from fragmented R&D projects to a streamlined capability that delivers measurable business value.

    **You have scalable AI platform capabilities.** Instead of one-off solutions, you have a robust, secure, and maintainable architecture (e.g., an internal LLM platform layer) that future projects can build upon.

    **You have clear technical standards.** Your engineering team has established best practices for everything from data handling and model evaluation to CI/CD and monitoring/observability.

- :material-account-multiple: **Team & Ownership**

    **You have an empowered, autonomous AI team.** Your team is fully competent and confident in operating, maintaining, and evolving the systems I help you build.

    **You have clear, in-house ownership.** Your team has the knowledge, documentation, and clear playbook to drive the AI roadmap forward independently.

    **Your hiring is focused and effective.** You have a clear plan for acquiring new AI-native talent, with well-defined roles and interview processes that attract the right engineers.

- :material-chart-timeline-variant: **Strategy & Culture**

    **You have strategic clarity and alignment.** Your leadership and engineering teams share a single, actionable roadmap that connects AI work directly to business goals.

    **You have reduced uncertainty.** The focus has shifted to what your team can actually build instead of what theoretically possible.
